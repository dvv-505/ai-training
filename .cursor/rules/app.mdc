# Overview

You are an expert in TypeScript and Node.js development. You are also an expert with common libraries and frameworks used in the industry. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.

## Tech Stack

The application we are working on uses the following tech stack:

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express
- Lodash
- Zod

## Shortcuts

- When provided with the words 'CURSOR:PAIR' this means you are to act as a pair programmer and senior developer, providing guidance and suggestions to the user. You are to provide alternatives the user may have not considered, and weigh in on the best course of action.
- When provided with the words 'RFC', refactor the code per the instructions provided. Follow the requirements of the instructions provided.
- When provided with the words 'RFP', improve the prompt provided to be clear.
  - Break it down into smaller steps. Provide a clear breakdown of the issue or question at hand at the start.
  - When breaking it down, ensure your writing follows Google's Technical Writing Style Guide.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Write straightforward, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Use strong typing and avoid 'any'
- Restate what the objective is of what you are being asked to change clearly in a short summary.
- Utilize Lodash, 'Promise.all()', and other standard techniques to optimize performance when working with large datasets

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

- Classes: PascalCase
- Variables, functions, methods: camelCase
- Files, directories: kebab-case
- Constants, env variables: UPPERCASE

### Functions

- Use descriptive names: verbs & nouns (e.g., getUserData)
- Prefer arrow functions for simple operations
- Use default parameters and object destructuring
- Document with JSDoc

### Types and Interfaces

- For any new types, prefer to create a Zod schema, and zod inference type for the created schema.
- Create custom types/interfaces for complex structures
- Use 'readonly' for immutable properties
- If an import is only used as a type in the file, use 'import type' instead of 'import'

## Code Review Checklist

- Ensure proper typing
- Check for code duplication
- Verify error handling
- Confirm test coverage
- Review naming conventions
- Assess overall code structure and readability

## Documentation

- When writing documentation, README's, technical writing, technical documentation, JSDocs or comments, always follow Google's Technical Writing Style Guide.
- Define terminology when needed
- Use the active voice
- Use the present tense
- Write in a clear and concise manner
- Present information in a logical order
- Use lists and tables when appropriate
- When writing JSDocs, only use TypeDoc compatible tags.
- Always write JSDocs for all code: classes, functions, methods, fields, types, interfaces.

## Git Commit Rules
- Make the head / title of the commit message brief
- Include elaborate details in the body of the commit message
- Always follow the conventional commit message format
- Add two newlines after the commit message title

## REST API Guidelines
- Use RESTful conventions for endpoint naming (e.g., `/users`, `/users/:id`).
- Return JSON responses with consistent structure: `{ data, error, status }`.
- Implement input validation using Zod schemas for all request bodies and query parameters.
- Use HTTP status codes correctly (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad input, 401 for unauthorized).
- Include pagination for list endpoints (e.g., `/users?limit=10&offset=0`).
- Handle CORS appropriately, allowing only specific origins in production.

## JWT Authentication
- Use JWT for all protected endpoints, validated via middleware.
- Store JWT secrets in environment variables (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`).
- Set JWT expiration to 1 hour for access tokens and 7 days for refresh tokens.
- Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing with a minimum salt of 12 rounds.
- Return 401 Unauthorized for invalid or expired tokens.

## Database and ORM
- Define database schemas using migrations (e.g., TypeORM, Sequelize, Knex).
- Seed initial data from JSONPlaceholder `/users` endpoint on database initialization.
- Normalize nested objects (e.g., `Address`, `Company`) into separate tables with foreign keys.
- Use transactions for operations affecting multiple tables.
- Avoid raw SQL queries; prefer ORM methods unless performance-critical.

## Error Handling
- Implement a global error handler middleware to catch and format errors.
- Return errors in JSON format: `{ error: { message, code, details } }`.
- Log errors with context (e.g., endpoint, user ID) using a logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino).
- Avoid exposing sensitive information (e.g., stack traces) in production responses.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic (e.g., services, utilities) using Jest.
- Write integration tests for all API endpoints using Supertest.
- Ensure at least 80% test coverage for all code.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., database, third-party APIs) in unit tests.
- Use descriptive test names: `should <action> when <condition>`.

## Containerization
- Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to minimize image size.
- Define environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` for database and JWT secrets.
- Ensure the database container initializes with migrations and seed data on startup.
- Use health checks in `docker-compose.yml` to verify service availability.
- Mount configuration files (e.g., `.env`) as volumes in development.

## Project Structure
- Organize code in a modular structure:
src/
controllers/   # Route handlers
services/      # Business logic
models/        # Database schemas and types
middleware/    # Authentication, validation, etc.
routes/        # API route definitions
utils/         # Helper functions and utilities
tests/         # Unit and integration tests
- Keep all configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`) in the project root.
- Store migration and seed scripts in `src/database/`.

## Performance
- Use Lodash for optimized data manipulation (e.g., `_.pick`, `_.merge`).
- Implement caching for frequently accessed endpoints (e.g., `/users`) using Redis or in-memory cache.
- Use `Promise.all` for parallel async operations when querying multiple resources.
